# :speaking_head: Beginner's Advice from the Author

- The whole reason for this repository is just to give beginners a working foundation that they can start working on.
- This repository will only contain the basic features for you to get started coding the Bot.
- This is because it is the user's responsibility to learn everything they need to know about DSharpPlus.

***"As programmers, do not expect the answers to just be handed to you on a plate. You are expected to research and study for yourself
things that you may not understand/don't know about the Bot" - Sam J***
