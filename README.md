# Welcome

# Note to Beginners

The whole reason for this repository is just to give beginners a working foundation that they can start working on.
This will not contain everything, as everything you need to start up the bot, and make basic commands has been put in for you, as it is the user's responsibility to learn everything they need to know about DSharpPlus.

***As programmers, do not expect the answers to just be handed to you on a plate. You are expected to research and study for yourself
things that you may not understand/don't know about the Bot***
