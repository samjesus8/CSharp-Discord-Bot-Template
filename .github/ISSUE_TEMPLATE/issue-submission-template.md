# Detailed Breakdown

Here you can explain your issue in a more detailed manner. Please follow these guidelines to make sure the person reading your issue doesn't have a hard time figuring it out

- Don't just copy and paste your code and the error messages and expect us to easily fix it for you
- Use ``` to provide snippets of your code in a readable format like this
```
Console.WriteLine("My Message");
```
- Please submit issues that are relevant to the content of this repository. Anything else will be closed automatically
- When you encounter an error, please tell us exactly what you did to receive this error and we will go from that basis to help fix it
- Please do keep in mind, that you have to do your research on the error before submitting issues to us. If you absolutely cannot find a solution to your problem, then you can come to us. This prevents issues with "obvious" answers from being submitted. So please, read what errors you may be getting and a quick google search may find you a solution

# Writing your Issue

This is a template that just shows you the guidelines, so once you know what to do, get rid of the help text in each section and start filling them out with your issue
